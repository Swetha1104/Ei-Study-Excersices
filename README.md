# Java Exercises: Design Patterns & Virtual Classroom Manager

This repository contains two Java exercises demonstrating software engineering concepts and best practices in object-oriented programming.

---

## Exercise 1: Design Patterns
This exercise demonstrates common software design patterns in Java.

### Creational
- **Factory Design Pattern** → `NotificationSystem.java`
- **Singleton Design Pattern** → `Healthcare` modules with database connection

### Structural
- **Adapter Design Pattern** → `MediaPlayerAdapterDemo.java`
- **Decorator Design Pattern** → `CoffeeShopDecoratorDemo.java`

### Behavioural
- **Chain of Responsibility** → `ExamReviewSystem`
- **Strategy Pattern** → `ECommerce` discount system

## Exercise 2: Virtual Classroom Manager
This exercise is a console-based simulation of a virtual classroom, built to practice project structuring, persistence, and logging.

### Features
- Manage students and classrooms  
- Track attendance records  
- Save/load data with persistence  
- Logging via `app.log`

### Project Structure
- `models/` → Core entities (`Student`, `Classroom`, `AttendanceRecord`)  
- `manager/` → Main logic (`VirtualClassroomManager.java`)  
- `persistence/` → Handles saving/loading (`PersistenceManager.java`)  
- `Main.java` → Entry point
